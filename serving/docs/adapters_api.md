# DJL Serving Adapters Management API

**Note that this API is experimental and is subject to change.

DJL Serving provides a set of API allow user to manage adapters at runtime:

1. [Register an adapter](#register-an-adapter)
3. [Describe an adapter's status](#describe-adapter)
4. [Unregister an adapter](#unregister-an-adapter)
5. [List registered adapters](#list-adapters)

This is an extension of the [Management API](management_api.md) and can be accessed the same.

## Adapter Management APIs

### Register an adapter

`POST /models/{modelName}/adapters`

* name - The adapter name.
* src - The adapter src. It currently requires a file, but eventually an id or URL can be supported depending on the model handler.
* All additional arguments will be treated as additional model-specific options and will be passed to the model during adapter registration

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/models/adaptecho/adapters?name=a1&src=..."

{
  "status": "Adapter \"a1\" registered."
}
```

### Describe adapter

`GET /models/{model_name}/adapters/{adapter_name}`

Use the Describe Adapter API to get the status of an adapter:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/models/adaptecho/adapters/a1

[
  {
    "name": "a1",
    "src": "..."
  }
]
```

### Unregister an adapter

`DELETE /models/{model_name}/adapters/{adapter_name}`

Use the Unregister Adapter API to free up system resources:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/models/adaptecho/adapters/a1

{
  "status": "Adapter \"a1\" unregistered"
}
```

### List adapters

`GET /models/{model_name}/adapters`

* limit - (optional) the maximum number of items to return. It is passed as a query parameter. The default value is `100`.
* next_page_token - (optional) queries for next page. It is passed as a query parameter. This value is return by a previous API call.

Use the Adapters API to query current registered adapters:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/models/adaptecho/adapters"
```

This API supports pagination:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/models/adaptecho/adapters?limit=2&next_page_token=0"

{
  "adapters": [
    {
      "name": "a1",
      "src": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Advanced

For the single model use case, the `/models/{model_name}` API prefix can be omitted resulting in queries such as `GET /adapters`.
