# TensorRT-LLM(TRT-LLM) Engine User Guide

## Model Artifacts Structure 

TRT-LLM LMI supports two options for model artifacts

1. [Standard HuggingFace model format](../deployment_guide/model-artifacts.md#huggingface-transformers-pretrained-format): In this case, TRT-LLM LMI will build TRT-LLM engines from HuggingFace model and package them with HuggingFace model config files during model load time.
2. [Custom TRT-LLM LMI model format](../deployment_guide/model-artifacts.md#tensorrt-llmtrt-llm-lmi-model-format): In this case, artifacts are directly loaded without the need to model compilation resulting in faster load times.

## Supported Model Architectures

The below model architectures are supported for JIT model compiltation and tested in our CI.

* LLaMA (since LMI V7 0.25.0)
* Falcon (since LMI V7 0.25.0)
* InternLM (since LMI V8 0.26.0)
* Baichuan (since LMI V8 0.26.0)
* ChatGLM (since LMI V8 0.26.0)
* GPT-J (since LMI V8 0.26.0)
* Mistral (since LMI V8 0.26.0)
* Mixtral (since LMI V8 0.26.0)
* Qwen (since LMI V8 0.26.0)
* GPT2/SantaCoder (since LMI V8 0.26.0)

TRT-LLM LMI v8 0.26.0 containers come with [TRT-LLM 0.7.1](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/releases/tag/v0.7.1). 
For models that are not listed here and supported by [TRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/tree/v0.7.1?tab=readme-ov-file#models) with [tensorrtllm_backend](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tensorrtllm_backend), you can use this [tutorial](../tutorials/trtllm_manual_convert_tutorial.md) instead to prepare model manually.

We will add more model support in the future versions in our CI. Please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl-serving/issues/new/choose) if you are looking for a specific model support.

## Quick Start Configurations

You can leverage `tensorrtllm` with LMI using the following starter configurations:

### serving.properties

```
engine=MPI
option.tensor_parallel_degree=max
option.rolling_batch=trtllm
option.model_id=<your model id>
# Adjust the following based on model size and instance type
option.max_rolling_batch_size=64
option.max_input_len=1024
option.max_output_len=512
```

You can follow [this example](../deployment_guide/deploying-your-endpoint.md#configuration---servingproperties) to deploy a model with serving.properties configuration on SageMaker.

### environment variables

````
HF_MODEL_ID=<your model id>
TENSOR_PARALLEL_DEGREE=max
OPTION_ROLLING_BATCH=trtllm
# Adjust the following based on model size and instance type
OPTION_MAX_ROLLING_BATCH_SIZE=64
OPTION_MAX_INPUT_LEN=1024
OPTION_MAX_OUTPUT_LEN=512
````

You can follow [this example](../deployment_guide/deploying-your-endpoint.md#configuration---environment-variables) to deploy a model with environment variable configuration on SageMaker.

## Quantization Support

We support two methods of quantization when using TensorRT-LLM with LMI: SmoothQuant, and AWQ.
You can enable these quantization strategies using `option.quantize=<smoothquant|awq>` in serving.properties, or `OPTION_QUANTIZE=<smoothquant|awq>` environment variable.
More details about additional (optional) quantization configurations are available in the advanced configuration table below.


##  Advanced TensorRT-LLM Configurations

Here are the advanced parameters that are available when using TensorRT-LLM.
Each advanced configuration is specified with a Configuration Type.
`LMI` means the configuration is processed by LMI and translated into the appropriate backend configurations.
`Pass Through` means the configuration is passed down directly to the library.
If you encounter an issue with a `Pass Through` configuration, it is likely an issue with the underlying library and not LMI.
