# LMI running Engines

In LMI, we offer two different running modes to operate the backend engine:

- Distributed Environment (MPI): Used to operate on single machine multi-gpu or multiple machines multi-gpu use cases
- Standard Python process (Python): Start a standalone python process to run the engine

You specify this operating mode through the `option.mpi_mode=<true|false>` configuration.

The operating modes for the built-in inference engines are described below.

- TensorRT-LLM (MPI): Use multiple MPI processes to run the backends
- LMI-Dist (MPI): Launching using multiple MPI processes to control for different GPUs
- vLLM (Python): vLLM internally will use Ray to spin up multiple processes
- HuggingFace Accelerate (Python): HF Accelerate internally managed the process workflow
- TransformerNeuronX (Python): The Neuron backend engine, internally it will use multi-threading to run with Neuron cores.

In the next section, we will introduce a detailed breakdown on how we run those backends.

## Python Engine operating in LMI (DJLServing)

In Python operating mode, LMI launches Python processes based on scanning
the system environment and number of Accelerators (GPU/Neuron) for each process through `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`. During auto-scaling mode,
LMI manages Accelerators allocation and spins up processes with different Accelerators (GPU/Neuron).
Under python Engine mode, LMI will establish socket connection and talk to the python process.

### Enablement

You can use the following ways to enable Python Engine:

serving.properties

```
engine=Python
option.mpi_mode=false
```

Environment variables

```
OPTION_ENGINE=Python
OPTION_MPI_MODE=false
```

We use python mode by default as long as you specify `option.model_id`.

## MPI Engine operating in LMI (DJLServing)

MPI in general means "Multi-Process-Interface". In LMI domain, you could also read as "Multi-Process-Inference".
DJLServing internally uses `mpirun` to spin up multiple processes depends on the setup.
The number of processes for LLM applications follows the `tensor_parallel_degree` configuration. 
LMI establishes multiple socket connects to each process for communication and health check.
During each operation call (e.g. inference), LMI will send the same request to each process. At response back time, 
LMI will just receive 1 result from rank 0 of the total processes.

MPI model also works well with LMI auto-scaling feature, user could specify multiple workers using different GPUs.
LMI will spin up the corresponding copies in MPI environment.

### Enablement

You can use the following ways to enable MPI Engine:

serving.properties

```
engine=Python
option.mpi_mode=true
```

Environment variable

```
OPTION_ENGINE=Python
OPTION_MPI_MODE=true
```
