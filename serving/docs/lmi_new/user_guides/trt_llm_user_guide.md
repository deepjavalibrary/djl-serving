# TensorRT-LLM(TRT-LLM) Engine User Guide

## Model Artifacts Structure 

TRT-LLM LMI supports two options for model artifacts

1.  [Standard HuggingFace model format](../deployment_guide/model-artifacts.md#huggingface-transformers-pretrained-format): In this case, TRT-LLM LMI will build TRT-LLM engines from HuggingFace model and package them with HuggingFace model config files during model load time.
2. [Custom TRT-LLM LMI model format](../deployment_guide/model-artifacts.md#tensorrt-llmtrt-llm-lmi-model-format): In this case, artifacts are directly loaded without the need to model compilation resulting in faster load times.



## Supported Model Architectures

The below model architectures are supported for JIT model compiltation and tested in our CI.

* LLaMA (since LMI V7 0.25.0)
* Falcon (since LMI V7 0.25.0)
* InternLM (since LMI V8 0.26.0)
* Baichuan (since LMI V8 0.26.0)
* ChatGLM (since LMI V8 0.26.0)
* GPT-J (since LMI V8 0.26.0)
* Mistral (since LMI V8 0.26.0)
* Mixtral (since LMI V8 0.26.0)
* Qwen (since LMI V8 0.26.0)
* GPT2/SantaCoder (since LMI V8 0.26.0)

TRT-LLM LMI v8 0.26.0 containers come with [TRT-LLM 0.7.1](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/releases/tag/v0.7.1). For models that are not listed here and supported by [TRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/tree/v0.7.1?tab=readme-ov-file#models) with [tensorrtllm_backend](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tensorrtllm_backend), you can use this [tutorial](../../lmi/tutorials/trtllm_manual_convert_tutorial.md) instead to prepare model manually.

We will add more model support in the future versions in our CI. Please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl-serving/issues/new/choose) if you are looking for a specific model support.


## SageMaker Deployment Tutorial
Users need to provide the model id of the model they want to deploy. Model id can be provided using `OPTION_MODEL_ID` environment variable which can take one of the following values
* Hugging Face model id
* s3 uri of Hugging Face model stored in s3
* s3 uri of pre-compiled TRT-LLM LMI model artifacts

We also need to set `SERVING_LOAD_MODELS` environment variable which can be set as below. 

```
SERVING_LOAD_MODELS=test::MPI=/opt/ml/model
OPTION_MODEL_ID=<your model id>
```

We also support customizing configuration to boost performance according to your specific use case. Please refer to `Common` and `TensorRT-LLM` sections in this [doc](../../lmi/configurations_large_model_inference_containers.md)

In this tutorial, we will use [SageMaker Python SDK](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk) to deploy the model on SageMaker. The below code can be run in SageMaker environment to deploy llama2-13b on g5.12xlarge instance. 

```
import sagemaker
from sagemaker import image_uris, Model, Predictor
from sagemaker.serializers import JSONSerializer
from sagemaker.deserializers import JSONDeserializer

# Setup role and sagemaker session
iam_role = sagemaker.get_execution_role()
sagemaker_session = sagemaker.session.Session()
region = sagemaker_session._region_name

# Fetch the uri of the TRT-LLM LMI container
container_image_uri = image_uris.retrieve(framework="djl-tensorrtllm", version="0.26.0", region=region)

# Create the SageMaker Model object. In this example we'll use vLLM as our inference backend
model = Model(
  image_uri=container_image_uri,
  role=iam_role,
  env={
    "SERVING_LOAD_MODELS": "model_name::MPI=/opt/ml/model",
    "OPTION_MODEL_ID": "TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-fp16",
  }
)

# Deploy your model to a SageMaker Endpoint and create a Predictor to make inference requests
endpoint_name = sagemaker.utils.name_from_base("llama-13b-trtllm-endpoint")
model.deploy(instance_type="ml.g5.12xlarge", initial_instance_count=1, endpoint_name=endpoint_name)
predictor = Predictor(
  endpoint_name=endpoint_name,
  sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session,
  serializer=JSONSerializer(),
  deserializer=JSONDeserializer(),
)


# Make an inference request against the llama2-13b endpoint
outputs = predictor.predict({
  "inputs": "The diamondback terrapin was the first reptile to be",
  "parameters": {
    "do_sample": True,
    "max_new_tokens": 256,
  }
})
print(outputs)
```
