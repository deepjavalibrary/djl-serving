Doubt not but heaven\n\nHath brought me up to be your daughter’s dower,\n\nAs it hath fated her to be my motive\n\nAnd helper to a husband. But, O strange men!\n\nThat can such sweet use make of what they hate,\n\nWhen saucy trusting of the cozen’d thoughts\n\nDefiles the pitchy night; so lust doth play\n\nWith what it loathes, for that which is away.\n\nBut more of this hereafter. You, Diana,\n\nUnder my poor instructions yet must suffer\n\nSomething in my behalf.\n\n\n\nDIANA.\n\nLet death and honesty\n\nGo with your impositions, I am yours\n\nUpon your will to suffer.\n\n\n\nHELENA.\n\nYet, I pray you;\n\nBut with the word the time will bring on summer,\n\nWhen briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,\n\nAnd be as sweet as sharp.

Your daughter-in-law had been alive at\n\nthis hour, and your son here at home, more advanc’d by the king than by\n\nthat red-tail’d humble-bee I speak of.\n\n\n\nCOUNTESS.\n\nI would I had not known him; it was the death of the most virtuous\n\ngentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If she had\n\npartaken of my flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I\n\ncould not have owed her a more rooted love.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\n’Twas a good lady, ’twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand salads ere\n\nwe light on such another herb.\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nIndeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the salad, or, rather, the\n\nherb of grace.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nThey are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nI am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in grass.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nWhether dost thou profess thyself,—a knave or a fool?\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nA fool, sir, at a woman’s service, and a knave at a man’s.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nYour distinction?\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nI would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nSo you were a knave at his service indeed.\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nAnd I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nI will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool.\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nAt your service.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nNo, no, no.\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nWhy, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a prince as you\n\nare.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nWho’s that? a Frenchman?\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nFaith, sir, ’a has an English name; but his phisnomy is more hotter in\n\nFrance than there.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nWhat prince is that?\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nThe black prince, sir; alias the prince of darkness; alias the devil.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nHold thee, there’s my purse. I give thee not this to suggest thee from\n\nthy master thou talk’st of; serve him still.\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nI am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire, and the\n\nmaster I speak of ever keeps a good fire. But sure he is the prince of\n\nthe world; let his nobility remain in’s court. I am for the house with\n\nthe narrow gate, which I take to be too little for pomp to enter: some\n\nthat humble themselves may, but the many will be too chill and tender,\n\nand they’ll be for the flow’ry way that leads to the broad gate and the\n\ngreat fire.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nGo thy ways, I begin to be a-weary of thee; and I tell thee so before,\n\nbecause I would not fall out with thee. Go thy ways; let my horses be\n\nwell look’d to, without any tricks.\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nIf I put any tricks upon ’em, sir, they shall be jades’ tricks, which\n\nare their own right by the law of nature.\n\n\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nA shrewd knave, and an unhappy.\n\n\n\nCOUNTESS.\n\nSo he is. My lord that’s gone made himself much sport out of him; by\n\nhis authority he remains here, which he thinks is a patent for his\n\nsauciness; and indeed he has no pace, but runs where he will.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nI like him well; ’tis not amiss. And I was about to tell you, since I\n\nheard of the good lady’s death, and that my lord your son was upon his\n\nreturn home, I moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of my\n\ndaughter; which, in the minority of them both, his majesty out of a\n\nself-gracious remembrance did first propose. His highness hath promis’d\n\nme to do it; and, to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against\n\nyour son, there is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?\n\n\n\nCOUNTESS.\n\nWith very much content, my lord, and I wish it happily effected.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nHis highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as when he\n\nnumber’d thirty; he will be here tomorrow, or I am deceived by him that\n\nin such intelligence hath seldom fail’d.\n\n\n\nCOUNTESS.\n\nIt rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die.

The army breaking,\n\nMy husband hies him home, where, heaven aiding,\n\nAnd by the leave of my good lord the king,\n\nWe’ll be before our welcome.\n\n\n\nWIDOW.\n\nGentle madam,\n\nYou never had a servant to whose trust\n\nYour business was more welcome.\n\n\n\nHELENA.\n\nNor you, mistress,\n\nEver a friend whose thoughts more truly labour\n\nTo recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven\n\nHath brought me up to be your daughter’s dower,\n\nAs it hath fated her to be my motive\n\nAnd helper to a husband. But, O strange men!\n\nThat can such sweet use make of what they hate,\n\nWhen saucy trusting of the cozen’d thoughts\n\nDefiles the pitchy night; so lust doth play\n\nWith what it loathes, for that which is away.\n\nBut more of this hereafter. You, Diana,\n\nUnder my poor instructions yet must suffer\n\nSomething in my behalf.\n\n\n\nDIANA.\n\nLet death and honesty\n\nGo with your impositions, I am yours\n\nUpon your will to suffer.\n\n\n\nHELENA.\n\nYet, I pray you;\n\nBut with the word the time will bring on summer,\n\nWhen briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,\n\nAnd be as sweet as sharp.

Rossillon. A room in the Countess’s palace.\n\n\n\n Enter Clown, Countess and Lafew.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nNo, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta fellow there,\n\nwhose villanous saffron would have made all the unbak’d and doughy\n\nyouth of a nation in his colour. Your daughter-in-law had been alive at\n\nthis hour, and your son here at home, more advanc’d by the king than by\n\nthat red-tail’d humble-bee I speak of.\n\n\n\nCOUNTESS.\n\nI would I had not known him; it was the death of the most virtuous\n\ngentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If she had\n\npartaken of my flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I\n\ncould not have owed her a more rooted love.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\n’Twas a good lady, ’twas a good lady. We may pick a thousand salads ere\n\nwe light on such another herb.\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nIndeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the salad, or, rather, the\n\nherb of grace.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nThey are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nI am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much skill in grass.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nWhether dost thou profess thyself,—a knave or a fool?\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nA fool, sir, at a woman’s service, and a knave at a man’s.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nYour distinction?\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nI would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nSo you were a knave at his service indeed.\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nAnd I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nI will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool.\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nAt your service.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nNo, no, no.\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nWhy, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as great a prince as you\n\nare.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nWho’s that? a Frenchman?\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nFaith, sir, ’a has an English name; but his phisnomy is more hotter in\n\nFrance than there.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nWhat prince is that?\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nThe black prince, sir; alias the prince of darkness; alias the devil.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nHold thee, there’s my purse. I give thee not this to suggest thee from\n\nthy master thou talk’st of; serve him still.\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nI am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a great fire, and the\n\nmaster I speak of ever keeps a good fire. But sure he is the prince of\n\nthe world; let his nobility remain in’s court. I am for the house with\n\nthe narrow gate, which I take to be too little for pomp to enter: some\n\nthat humble themselves may, but the many will be too chill and tender,\n\nand they’ll be for the flow’ry way that leads to the broad gate and the\n\ngreat fire.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nGo thy ways, I begin to be a-weary of thee; and I tell thee so before,\n\nbecause I would not fall out with thee. Go thy ways; let my horses be\n\nwell look’d to, without any tricks.\n\n\n\nCLOWN.\n\nIf I put any tricks upon ’em, sir, they shall be jades’ tricks, which\n\nare their own right by the law of nature.\n\n\n\n [_Exit._]\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nA shrewd knave, and an unhappy.\n\n\n\nCOUNTESS.\n\nSo he is. My lord that’s gone made himself much sport out of him; by\n\nhis authority he remains here, which he thinks is a patent for his\n\nsauciness; and indeed he has no pace, but runs where he will.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nI like him well; ’tis not amiss. And I was about to tell you, since I\n\nheard of the good lady’s death, and that my lord your son was upon his\n\nreturn home, I moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of my\n\ndaughter; which, in the minority of them both, his majesty out of a\n\nself-gracious remembrance did first propose. His highness hath promis’d\n\nme to do it; and, to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against\n\nyour son, there is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?\n\n\n\nCOUNTESS.\n\nWith very much content, my lord, and I wish it happily effected.\n\n\n\nLAFEW.\n\nHis highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as when he\n\nnumber’d thirty; he will be here tomorrow, or I am deceived by him that\n\nin such intelligence hath seldom fail’d.\n\n\n\nCOUNTESS.\n\nIt rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die.
