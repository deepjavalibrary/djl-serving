# DJLServing prometheus metrics support

## DJLServing metrics

DJL provide the types of metrics:

- Server metrics: saved in `$MODELSERVER_HOME/logs/server_metrics.log`
- Model metrics: save in `$MODELSERVER_HOME/logs/model_metric.log`

## Prometheus metrics

Those metrics can be collected as prometheus metrics, you need set `SERVING_PROMETHEUS` environment
variable or System properties to enable it.

Once you enabled prometheus metrics, you can use [get metric management REST API](../serving/docs/management_api.md#get-metrics) to get metrics.

### Per request metric

Per request metrics is disabled by default, set the following option to enable per request metric:

```
log_request_metric=true
```

By default, per request metrics will be aggregated every `1000` requests. You can change
aggregated with the following:

```
metrics_aggregation=100
```
